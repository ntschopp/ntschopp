### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for stopping by! My name is Neil and I am a data scientist born and raised in the midwest. I love to travel and I consider myself to be a very curious person. Of the many hobbies I have, I'd say baseball and music interest more than anything. I am most skilled in Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

I have a very open mind and will talk about just about anything.

Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-tschopp/) if you would like to chat. ðŸ˜„
